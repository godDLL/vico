<h1>Moving by words</h1>

<p>To move to the next word, use the <kbd>w</kbd> command.</p>

<p>The <kbd>w</kbd> command considers separator characters when deciding where the
next word starts. To only consider whitespace as word separators, you can use
the (uppercase) <kbd>W</kbd> command.</p>

<p>To move in the opposite direction, use the <kbd>b</kbd> command to move over a
normal word, and the capital <kbd>B</kbd> command to move over "big words".</p>

<p>There is also the <kbd>e</kbd> and <kbd>E</kbd> commands that move to the <em>end</em>
of the next word or bigword.</p>

<p>If you prefix the above commands with a number, the command will move that many
words. For example, the command <kbd>3w</kbd> will move three words to the right.</p>
