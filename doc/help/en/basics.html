<h1>Editing Basics</h1>

<p>Vico is a modal editor. This means there are different modes
in which you interact with the editor. The most fundamental modes
are the insert mode and normal mode. Regular keys pressed while
in insert mode causes text to be inserted. In contrast, while in
normal mode, regular keys are attached to editing commands such as
delete, change or copy text.</p>

<p>If you have used the <kbd>vi</kbd> or <kbd>vim</kbd> text editors,
you should feel comfortable with Vico. If this is your first encounter
with a modal editor, you might feel a bit overwhelmed at first. But
if you give it some time and learn the basics, you'll be rewarded with
a highly efficient text editing tool.</p>
